We finally re-released the long-awaited update of Find the Harf, our first ever Android game!  You can download it [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deengames.findtheharf) or read more about it on the [Deen Games website](http://deengames.com/find-the-harf.html).

The original version suffered from many audio problems, with a large number of users seeing audio crash entirely during play. All these problems should be resolved.

In addition, we removed the the "customize the letters shown" functionality. This was a source of endless bugs (and a *lot* of extra work), and based on our numbers, less than 1% of our users actually use it. 

We hope you like this new iteration!  As usual, drop us your comments here (or on Facebook) and let us know what you think.
