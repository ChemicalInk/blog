The last couple of weeks mostly entailed playtesting and game-balancing tweaks. As a result, we made a few visible changes:

- Squid (blue rectangle) now move erratically and require more effort to capture.
- There's a new "Sense of Smell"  upgrade that materializes as a white arrow, and shows you where the next creature will appear. In the GIF above, it predicts a shark, then a squid.
- Krill now appear in abundance, but net you only one food per catch.
- Shrank swimming crabs slightly.

You can see these changes in the GIF above. We plan to continue playtesting and tweaking in the next weeks.
