We're excited to announce our very first Android app, Control Your Tongue! This app helps kids aged 5-9 practice makhraj (pronounciation) of the Arabic letters, while reciting words used throughout the Qur'an.

You can download it [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deengames.controlyourtongue).

You can compare your voice to a pre-recorded version to see how close you can get to the intended recitation; and you can choose whichever letters and makharij to go through, at your own pace.

We created this game over a month, as a collaborative effort with a new developer. This early version ships with only one makharij (jawf / oral-cavity). InshaAllah we plan to add more over the coming months.

We hope you enjoy it and benefit from it!  As usual, drop us your comments here (or on Facebook) and let us know what you think.
