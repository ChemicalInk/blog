meta-title: Social Media Strategy
meta-publishedOn: 2017-07-08

While we're still getting the hang of social media, we finally formulated a cohesive and clear strategy for our social media. Depending on your needs, you may be interested in how these different streams play out:

- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/deengames): Daily updates on new features and in-progress work.
- [Patreon](http://patreon.com/deengames) and this Blog: Weekly aggregate updates on the current project, cancellations, and what's going on with the humans in Deen Games
- [Facebook](http://facebook.com/deengames): Similar to Patreon. Also includes bi-weekly or monthly updates on projects and things that are generally ready for release (or close to it).
