In agile software, one of the useful processes includes showing the demo of the current sprint/iteration to customers (or a customer placeholder). How can we adopt and benefit from this practice as game developers?

This hinges on one of the key tenants of agile development: stories, or units of work, should be *user facing.* If we can write small, user-facing units of work, and complete them, they should be demoable.

One of the best ways to do this, while simultanously building hype for your game, is to take videos (or even GIFs) and promote them on your blog. This gives you a chance to show what you worked on, build a readership, build up hype for your game, and get the word out about what you're working on.

This also forces you to constantly evaluate your work and make it somehow meaningful to users. When you complete something, you automatically start thinking: how can I make a short demo of it?

Once you get into the habit of posting demos, it's easier to take this to the next step, and have a functional game that you can give your play-testers at virtually any stage of development; that's fantastic for getting real feedback on your game.

You can also cross-promote your new blog post on social media for extra marketing *umph*. This generates interest in your projects as they unfold.
